Verovio is licensed under the [OSI](https://opensource.org/)-approved [GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPLv3)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). This means that Verovio can be used in any contexts that are compliant with the requirements of that license. In this section, we explain more concretely what you can do with it in your project, but also what is required or not allowed for you to do, and what we additionally recommend.

### What is allowed

The LGPLv3 license allows you to use the Verovio library as-is in open-source projects that are compliant with this license. It can also be used in commercial products that are open-source or not. It can be a web application, a desktop application or a mobile one. The Verovio library can be embedded in the product and shipped with it without having your product itself to be open-source as long as the library **remains not modified** and is dynamically linked to your product.

### What is required

Whichever use you make of library, you have to give **visible credits** to the Verovio library. For a web application, it has to be through a prominent notice on your web-site. For a mobile application, it has to be given in the metadata of the application (e.g., iOS AppStore or the Google Play store).

Here are some minimal examples to follow:
* NomadPlay [web application](https://www.nomadplay.app/fr/legal-notice) and in the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/nomadplay-partitions-musique/id1443790777)
* Trala in the [AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/trala-learn-violin/id1143205265)

Using Verovio in a product without giving credits to it is a clear copy-right violation. However, it is also important to understand that, by giving the appropriate credits, you are not only fulfilling the very basic and free-of-charge requirements of the license but also supporting the community by recognizing its work. The will help to make it more sustainable and only be beneficial to all users - including you - in the long-run.

### What is not allowed

You are not allowed to make any modifications to the Verovio library without making all of these available to the community and under the original LGPLv3 license. For example, if you improve the layout algorithm, or add support for additional music notation elements, these improvements have to be made open-source under LGPLv3. Not doing it is also a copy-right violation and un-supportive of the community.

### What is recommended

Making the source code of your modifications to the Verovio library available to the community is only the minimal legal requirement. However, we strongly encourage you to go one step further and to ask for your changes to be integrated into the original code-base of Verovio with a pull-request to the [rism-digital/verovio](https://github.com/rism-digital/verovio) repository. Before your changes can be integrated into the repository, we will need you to accept the Verovio [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://rism.digital/resources/verovio-cla.pdf). This is a standard procedure for open-source projects and will allow for the community to benefit directly from your work.
