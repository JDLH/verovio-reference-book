title: "Score navigation"

In this final part of the introductory tutorial, we will take what we have learned about Verovio and produce an interactive score, where your users can adjust the behaviour of Verovio and see the display updated.

### Creating the controls

Before we start we will need to create some HTML form controls. These controls will do the following:

 - A slider to adjust the scaling factor;
 - "Next page" and "Previous page" buttons for navigating the score;
 - A checkbox for adjusting the orientation (portrait or landscape)

If you are not familiar with how HTML form controls are created, you may wish to consult the [Basic form controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls) and the [HTML5 input types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types) documentation.
