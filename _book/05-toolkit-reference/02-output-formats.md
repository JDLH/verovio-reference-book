### SVG

#### Font limitation

Firefox on Linux (Ubuntu), uses "DejaVu Serif" as default font, which can cause some text layout problems when displaying the SVG files generated with Verovio. 
    
### MEI

#### Page-based MEI

{% aside .warning %}
The MEI page-based model is not part of MEI. It was put in place for the development of Verovio and can still change in the future. It will be documented as input format once it is stabilized.
